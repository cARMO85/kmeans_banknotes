## Project Overview

This project aims to utilize machine learning, particularly K-means clustering, to automate the detection of counterfeit banknotes. By employing data-driven methods, this project enhances both the efficiency and reliability of forgery detection compared to traditional manual methods.

## Data Description

The dataset comprises various features extracted from images of genuine and counterfeit banknotes. These features include texture, dimensions, and other specific characteristics that distinguish genuine banknotes from forgeries.

## Report for Non-Data Science Audience
A comprehensive report has been prepared for stakeholders and individuals without a data science background. You can access it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iVeePoFZ7KYMp9crsXs-j1yEyR7UESio/view?usp=sharing).

## Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/cARMO85/kmeans_banknotes.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd kmeans_banknotes

# Run the Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook kmeans.ipynb
```

## Usage
Open kmeans.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment and run all cells. For further customization, you can modify the parameters for K-means clustering as needed.
